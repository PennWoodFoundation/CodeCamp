# WPSD CodeCamp
Repository for everything related to WPSD CodeCamp 2021

## Name
The event is temporarily named Code Camp.  This is still to be decided upon.

## Purpose
The purpose of the event is for students to build a web application in 48 hours that offers a technical solution to a problem.  Students are grouped into teams and are instructed in web technologies as they build their application.

## Skills
- HTML / CSS
- JavaScript
- "Serverless" cloud services
    - API services / Code as a service
    - Web hosting services
    - Storage
    - AI / Machine learning services
- Git / GitHub
    - Team collaboration
    - Publishing of static sites

## Tools

It is the goal of this event that everything can be done in a web browser.  This allows Chromebooks to be utilized.  It wouldn't preclude the use of any other device, but everything needs to work on a Chromebook.

- IDEs / Code Editors (to be evaluated)
    - codesandbox.io
    - repl.it
- Cloud Services (to be evaluated)
    - [Azure for Students Starter](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/starter/)
    - [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/students/)
- Deployment (to be evaluated)
    - GitHub PAges (only works for static sites)
    - Azure Web Apps (free tier inclused with AfSS above)

### Key points to evaluate

**IDEs**: When evaluating IDEs, we want to make sure students can do the following.
- Easy sign-up (existing credential preferred)
- Ease of use
- Team collaboration (Google Docs style coding experience) should be considered
- Ease of committing to GitHub
- Easy to test applications in progress

**Source control**: It makes little sense to use anything other than Git and GitHub, as it is the clear leader in being the world's place for code.  However, *teaching* Git can be really challenging.  Git is challenging for many career developers.  We need to explore this, and besides getting better with Git ourselves, we need to examine the common pitfalls and help avoid them.
**This may be our most challenging issue**
- Once teams start working parallel, they'll likely need to understand concepts of merging and conflicts.
- Allowing team freedom to collaborate without confusion or despair
- Avoid team choosing to rely on a single person to code everything due to team collaboration frustration

**Design**: Just because I am a developer doesn't mean the students shouldn't have an opportunity to learn great design... this means web design and graphic design.  Our artists should be able to create and have their work included and our design minded thinkers should be able to showcase this.
- Should we look for Chromebook ready design tools and art tools
- Should we include some instruction on this during the event

## Ideal Entries

I am attaching the previous year rubrics for examination:
[Student Code-A-Thon.Rubric.2020.pdf](Student Code-A-Thon.Rubric.2020.pdf)
[Judges Code-A-Thon.Rubric.2020.pdf](Judges Code-A-Thon.Rubric.2020.pdf)

Many previous sites can be viewed from the [Penn Wood Foundation GitHub](https://github.com/pennwoodfoundation) site.

We are all proud of all the work the students have done in previous years.  We want to elevate the applications they are producing.

In previous years, web sites might be viewed as reports or presentations on a global problem.  If a solution was proposed, the site did not offer any prototype or demonstration technology. 

For example, we have not yet had sites that:
- Communicate with APIs
- Save and load visitor profile data
- Allow uploads or contributions
- Detect location, push text notifications
- Form an interactive community
- Show location on a map

I would make the following preference statements:

I want to see:
- Sites that are built with the students newly learned mastery of HTML/CSS over sites where the students chose web templates and changed the copy
- Sites that propose a problem and solution that can be addressed by using the site over those that propose super global nonprofits that are not likely to come to fruition
- Sites that solve the problem interactively over sites that are a research report on the problem

We could all theoretically sign up with a credit card and set spending to zero.
